    <h1>Gramm Leach Bliley Act</h1>
    <p>
      Also known as the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, is an act
      of the 106th United States Congress (1999–2001). It repealed part of the
      Glass–Steagall Act of 1933, removing barriers in the market among banking
      companies, securities companies, and insurance companies that prohibited
      any one institution from acting as any combination of an investment bank,
      a commercial bank, and an insurance company. With the passage of the
      Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, commercial banks, investment banks, securities
      firms, and insurance companies were allowed to consolidate. Furthermore,
      it failed to give to the SEC or any other financial regulatory agency the
      authority to regulate large investment bank holding companies.[1] The
      legislation was signed into law by President Bill
